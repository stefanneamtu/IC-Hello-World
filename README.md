The Big Idea:

Keep up with existing friends:
- send reminders to people to catch up (maybe by going through calendar or registering on app)
- ability to add events to calendar and/or schedule meetups eg picking a place to have a (socially distanced) meetup or launching a zoom meeting
- select activities to do together randomly
